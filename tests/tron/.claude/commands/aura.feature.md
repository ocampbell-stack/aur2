# Feature Planning

Create a plan in `specs/<feature-name>.md` to implement the feature.

## Instructions

- Research the codebase before planning. Start with `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` if they exist.
- Create the plan as `specs/<feature-name>.md`.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Keep solutions simple and focused.

## Relevant Files

- `README.md` - Project overview
- `CLAUDE.md` - Agent instructions
- `specs/` - Example specs if they exist

## Plan Format

```md
# Feature: <feature name>

## Feature Description
