I want to add player movement to the tron game. The player should be able
to use arrow keys to control the light bike. When you press up, the bike
goes up. Down goes down. Left and right work the same way.

The bike should leave a trail behind it as it moves. The trail should be
a different color from the bike itself.

For now, don't worry about collision detection or game over - just get
the movement and trail working.

Actually, let's break this into two parts: first just get movement working,
then add the trail as a second phase.
